# Novusk

Novusk - A kernel written in Rust inspired by Linux

# Wanted Features
- Optimised for RISC V only. No x86 and ARM. Though ARM is of interest for now on rpi.
- Drivers targeted at specific hardware and builtin to the kernel
- Standard monolithic kernel features based on latest standards and features -> btrfs, object orientation over files, loose coupling between layers for modularity but stronger theming.

# Documentation Structure
Each rust dir has its own associated README.md detailing what the source code is about.

# ARM-ONLY BRANCH
Targets RPI64.
