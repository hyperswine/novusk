# Novusk

Novusk - A kernel written in Rust inspired by Linux

# Wanted Features
- Optimised for RISC V only
- Drivers targeted at specific hardware and builtin to the kernel
- Standard monolithic kernel features based on latest standards and features -> btrfs, object orientation over files, loose coupling between layers for modularity but stronger theming.
